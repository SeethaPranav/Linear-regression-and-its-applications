# Linear-regression-and-its-applications
A deep dive into linear regression, covering its fundamentals, real-world applications, and how it models relationships between variables for predictive analysis.

Linear Regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (predictors).

## Applications of Linear Regression
Predictive Modeling:

House price prediction based on features like area, location, etc. Sales forecasting using past sales data.

Trend Analysis:

Stock market trends. Temperature prediction based on historical data.

Risk Assessment:

Predicting insurance claims. Assessing loan default risk.

Healthcare:

Predicting patient health outcomes (e.g., disease progression based on age and medical history).

Optimization:

Business operations improvement (e.g., predicting demand for supply chain optimization).

## Advantages
Easy to interpret and implement.

Works well with linearly correlated data.

Efficient for large datasets.

## Limitations
Assumes linearity; cannot model non-linear relationships effectively.

Sensitive to outliers and multicollinearity.

Requires normally distributed residuals for optimal performance.
